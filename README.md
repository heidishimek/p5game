Assignment Description: For your final project we will expand upon your base knowledge of the p5.js main library by exploring and incorporating other libraries such as p5.play to create game-like applications. You will build off of the game examples provided to create your own interactive experiences featuring a game with different levels to be housed within a refined, well-designed website.

For the final project, my inspiration for the project came from the artist Taubaauer Bach, specifically the piece â€œThe Whole Alphabet, From the Center Out" that I noted at the San Francisco MOMA. I was able to use the exact colors from the piece to design my project. I came up with a series of three mazes, one with all the colors, one with fewer colors, and the most difficult was with two colors. I chose a maze because the art was essentially a maze of figuring out where each letter was. I also played with the colors and levels of difficulty because in the MOMA there was a piece in color and one in black and white. The balck and white was much harder to differentiate colors, thus why my hardest level is made up of two colors
